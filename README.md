Task 4 – Code Refactoring Report
Project: Simple JavaScript To-Do List
Before Refactor
Used unclear single-letter variable and function names (a, b, c)
Hard to understand code flow
No handling for empty inputs
Used manual for-loop instead of modern methods
Changes Made
Renamed variables and functions to meaningful names (tasks, addTask, displayTasks, etc.)
Used trim() to prevent adding empty tasks
Used forEach instead of for loop for readability
Added HTML file to test easily
Impact on Readability & Performance
Code is now self-documenting and easier to maintain
Slightly better performance with forEach in modern browsers
Safer input handling (ignore blank tasks)
Files Included
original.js – messy original code
refactored.js – improved code
index.html – testing interface
REPORT.md – this explanation
Refactoring improves code quality, maintainability, and prevents bugs.
